      <h2>What is <em>StudyForrest</em>?</h2>
      <p>The <strong>human brain</strong> processes vast amounts of diverse
         input that are continuously gathered across the senses. However, most
         experiments study the brain via simplified stimuli that do little to
         resemble the complexity of a <strong>natural environment</strong>
         &mdash; a mismatch that must be addressed if we are to better
         understand how the brain works.</p>
      <p>This project centers around the use of <strong>the movie Forrest
         Gump</strong>, which provides complex sensory input that is both
         reproducible and is also richly laden with real-life-like content and
         contexts.</p>
      <p>Since its initial release, the <em>StudyForrest</em> dataset has grown
         and been extended substantially and now encompasses many <strong>hours
         of fMRI scans</strong>, structural brain scans, <strong>eye-tracking</strong>
         data, and extensive <strong>annotations</strong> of the movie. Explore
         the <a href="/data.html">Data Page</a> to more closely examine the data
         we have available.</p>

        <h3>Neuroscience Researchers</h3>
        <p>This is a <strong>one-of-a-kind resource</strong> for studying
           high-level cognition in the human brain under complex, natural
           stimulation. Furthermore, the versatility of the provided data (some
           individuals have almost ten hours of fMRI data), enables studies far
           beyond this main focus. This covers a vast range from studies of
           low-level signal properties and brain structure, over sensory
           integration and attentional processes, to computational modeling of
           representational spaces and brain area interactions. Take a look the
           <a href="/publications.html">List of Publications</a> to get
           inspired.</p>

        <h3>Scientific Developers</h3>
        <p>The <em>StudyForrest</em> project provides <strong>ideal reference
           datasets</strong> for brain imaging. It's a comprehensive, modular,
           multi-modal, real-world dataset &mdash; making it an optimal choice
           when benchmarking algorithms or comparing implementations across
           projects.</p>
        <p>Liberally licensed (<a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/">PDDL</a>)
           and hosted across many <a href="/access.html">different services</a>
           (OpenNeuro, GIN, etc) with fine-grained access options, the
           <em>StudyForrest</em> dataset is easily accessible and is ready to be
           integrated into your CI infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>Everyone &mdash;&nbsp;and&nbsp;You</h3>
        <p>Not keen on brain research? This project still has something to offer
           to you! For example, our effort to analyze the <strong>structure of
           the movie <em>Forrest Gump</em></strong> and annotate its properties
           expands the breadth of topics that can be explored. Check out the
           <a href="/data.html">Data Page</a> for more specifics.</p>
        <p>What we're most interested in is applications and inquiries that we
           have not anticipated &mdash; both within the field of neuroscience
           and beyond. So please, invent applications and <strong>explore ideas
           you have</strong> that we aren't even aware of... and do tell us
           about them!</p>

      <h2>How are People Using It?</h2>
      <p>This dataset has been used in over two dozen <a href="publications.html">studies</a>
         to investigate particular research questions or to validate novel
         tools and algorithms.</p>
